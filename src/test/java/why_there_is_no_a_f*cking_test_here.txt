I know. Tests are important. In fact, I would say that they are essential if you 
want to develop something fairly serious and maintainable over time. No excuses, 
I'm lazy. It's not my fault, it's the DNA. Nothing can be done. The good news is 
that although I'm lazy, I'm also a perfectionist, so I've put a lot of care and 
love into making everything work as it should. However, if you really like to do 
QA I encourage you to collaborate with me developing some tests.

Carpe diem.
